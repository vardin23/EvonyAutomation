# EvonyAutomation
_This is an outdated version of an improved tool of which the source code was lost_

A tool to automate several tasks in Evony(an android RPG)

Rally joiner files will join optimal rallies for the particular instance of the emulator , if the instance is different  , the same can be edited in the rally joiner file.

While instance name dependence throught the code has been tried to depend entirely on one variable , the overall program is divided into multiple modules so there might be situations where editing $instx won't be enough to entirely run the automator for that instance.
